# HGBL: A Benchmark Library for Heterogeneous Graph
## Introduction
To accommodate the urgent requirement of emerging fields and the advance of Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs), we build a new benchmark for two new fields: risky product detection and takeout recommendation. Besides that, we establish a benchmark library with over 30 heterogeneous graph datasets from other fields and providea powerful and novel toolkit to research the characteristics of graph datasets
